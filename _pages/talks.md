I regularly speak and contribute expertise on data science, social research methodology, and technology innovation. My work reaches diverse audiences through academic conferences and media commentary, where I share insights on emerging trends in social science and technology.

As an educator and trainer, I lead specialized courses in advanced research methods and data infrastructure. My teaching portfolio includes survey statistics and public opinion research, big data applications in social research, and advanced statistical methods.

I'm particularly passionate about advancing technical leadership and best practices in research. I have developed and led comprehensive training programs in computational reproducibility, statistical programming, and research writing. These programs emphasize practical implementation of research methodologies and software development best practices for social researchers.
