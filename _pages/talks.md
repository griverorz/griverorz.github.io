I contribute expertise in data science, research methodology, and technology innovation through academic and professional conferences and media engagements.

As an educator and trainer, I lead specialized courses in **research methods and data infrastructure**. My teaching portfolio includes short and long courses survey statistics and public opinion research, big data applications in social research, and data infrastructure for public sector and mission-driven research organizations. 

I am passionate about advancing technical leadership and research best practices. I have developed training programs spanning the entire research pipeline: from data collection and reproducibility to research writing and communication, helping researchers and data professionals build **robust, sustainable and effective workflows**.
