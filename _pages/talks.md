I share my expertise in data science, research methodology, and innovation at academic and professional conferences and through media engagements.

I also lead specialized courses in **research methods and data infrastructure** for public sector and mission-driven research organizations. These training programs span the entire research pipeline ---from data collection to writing and communication--- helping teams build robust, sustainable workflows.

As a consultant, I have guided diverse organizations, such as statistical institutes, government agencies and private companies, to help them develop data innovation strategies, modern research practices, and research-to-practice initiatives.
