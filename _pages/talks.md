I contribute expertise in data science, research methodology, and technology innovation through academic and professional conferences and media engagements.

As an educator and trainer, I am passionate about advancing **technical leadership and research best practices.** I lead specialized courses in research methods and data infrastructure for public sector and mission-driven research organizations. These training programs span the entire research pipeline -- from data collection and reproducibility to research writing and communication -- helping teams build robust, sustainable workflows.

I have also offered **guidance to organizations across sectors** -- from statistical institutes and government agencies to private companies -- helping them develop data innovation strategies, mdernize research practices, and strengthen research-to-practice initiatives.
