I lead research in the areas of applied data science and social science.

A political scientist by training, my trajectory has covered the impact of [online tools](https://www.amazon.com/Retooling-Politics-Digital-Shaping-Democracy/dp/1108419402) on institutional and contentious politics, the [political economy of representation](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0176268015000592), and the causes and consequences of [corruption](https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/political-science-research-and-methods/article/rooting-out-corruption-or-rooting-for-corruption-the-heterogeneous-electoral-consequences-of-scandals/902FCB9C6DF2CCB1DB73E57AC07AD5D4). 

My expertise bridges academic research with practical applications, integrating new [data sources,](https://www.journals.uchicago.edu/doi/pdf/10.1086/709672) [tools,](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/1525822X221107053) and [methods](https://rsa.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/21582041.2017.1325924) into social research and public policy.
