I lead innovative research at the intersection of data science and social behavior, investigating how individual attitudes shape collective outcomes. My work has developed new approaches to understanding political representation, from [individual attitudes](https://www.journals.uchicago.edu/doi/pdf/10.1086/709672) to [behavioral patterns](https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/political-science-research-and-methods/article/rooting-out-corruption-or-rooting-for-corruption-the-heterogeneous-electoral-consequences-of-scandals/902FCB9C6DF2CCB1DB73E57AC07AD5D4) and [institutional dynamics](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0176268015000592).

My research trajectory spans three key areas:
1. **Digital transformation of society,** examining how [online tools](https://www.amazon.com/Retooling-Politics-Digital-Shaping-Democracy/dp/1108419402) reshape institutional and contentious politics.
2. **Machine learning applications in social research,** developing [methods](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/1525822X221107053) for data collection and analysis.
3. **Statistical innovation,** creating new [methodological frameworks](https://rsa.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/21582041.2017.1325924) for measuring social attitudes in both digital and traditional contexts.

My expertise bridges rigorous academic research with practical applications, integrating new data sources, tools, and methods into social research and public policy.
