I am social scientist specialized in building and leading **research and data
science teams** in mission-driven organizations. I help companies, nonprofits, and
public-sector entities establish modern research-to-practice teams that
integrate **emerging tools, technologies, and methods.**

I currently serve as the **founding director of Data Lab** at the [Washington Metropolitan Area Transit Authority](https://www.wmata.com), a team tasked with building "innovative, data-driven solutions that bridge research and practice." We help Metro operate more efficiently, adapt to change and serve the community better every day.

Before joining WMATA, I was the associate director of Data Labs, the computational social research team of [Pew Research Center](https://www.pewresearch.org). I previously worked in the Statistics and Data Science division of [Westat](https://www.westat.com), and in the Scientific Research Group of [YouGov](https://www.yougov.com). I received an MA and Ph.D. in Politics from [New York University](http://politics.as.nyu.edu/page/home) and an MA in Social Sciences from the [Center for Advanced Studies in Social Sciences](https://ic3jm.es/sobre-ic3jm/el-instituto/) of the Juan March Institute.
