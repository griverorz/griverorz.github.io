I am a research scientist and research leader specialized in the collection and analysis of digital data for social sciences and public services. I help organizations build modern data teams and functions that integrate emerging tools and methods.

I currently serve as the founding director of the Data Lab of the [Washington Metropolitan Area Transit Authority](https://www.wmata.com), a team tasked with building "innovative, data-driven solutions that bridge research and practice." We help Metro operate more efficiently, adapt to change and serve the community better every day.
