I am a research scientist specialized in the collection and analysis
of digital data for social research and public policy. I often write
about the impact of digital tools on political representation and
about research methodology.

I currently serve as director of the Data Lab of the [Washington Metropolitan Area Transit Authority](https://www.wmata.com), a team tasked with "keeping Metro on the leading edge of the transit industry through applied research." My team manages an agency-wide research portfolio, oversees data strategy and governance, and builds tools to help Metro meet its strategic goals.
